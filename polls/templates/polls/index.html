{% load static %}

<!--The {% static %} template tag is not available for use in static files which arenâ€™t generated by Django, like your stylesheet. 
You should always use relative paths to link your static files between each other, because then you can change STATIC_URL (used by the static template tag to generate its URLs) 
without having to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as well.-->
